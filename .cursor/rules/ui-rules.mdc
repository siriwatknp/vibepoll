- When working on user interfaces, first check if [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) can be used.
- Use [Shadcn UI](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) components by pulling from `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- Look for icon from [Lucide React](mdc:https:/lucide.dev/icons) first, but create a custom svg if there is no match.
